                    <p>Answer: To mimic slow internet speeds to test website performance. Therefore observing page loading behavior
                    under limited bandwith. Identify slow-loading elements (large images, unoptimized scripts).
                    and to improve user experience for mobile user with poor connections.</p>

                    <h2> In Summary</h2>

                     JavaScript, images,and API calls. It enables developers to check load times, filter specific request types,
                    and inspect headers and responses for debugging. Additionally, 
                    <strong>Slow 3g Throttling </strong> simulates a slow internet connection, 
                    allowing developers to analyze page performance under limited bandwidth, 
                    identify boottlenecks, and optimize loading strategies for a better user experience. 
                    Together, these tools help developers inspect, debug, and optimize webpages effectively.</p></p>
